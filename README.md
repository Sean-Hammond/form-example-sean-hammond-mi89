### Contributors

I built this website from a template. This template was built as part of the [Full Stack Developer course](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/part-time-full-stack-developer) at [4Geeks Academy Coding Bootcamp](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamp) by [Alejandro Sanchez](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr) and [many other contributors](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello/graphs/contributors).

You can find other templates and resources like this at the [school's GitHub page](https://github.com/4geeksacademy/).
